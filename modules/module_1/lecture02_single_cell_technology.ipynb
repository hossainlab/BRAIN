    "### The Challenge of Cellular Heterogeneity\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional bulk RNA sequencing measures the average gene expression across millions of cells, masking the remarkable diversity present in biological tissues.

    "## 4. 10X Genomics Chromium Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "### Droplet Microfluidics Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The 10X Chromium system uses **droplet microfluidics** to partition individual cells with barcoded beads:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Cell Preparation\n",
    "- Dissociate tissue into single-cell suspension\n",
    "- Target: 700-1,200 viable cells/μL\n",
    "- Mix with Master Mix (RT reagents)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: GEM Generation (Gel Bead-in-Emulsion)\n",
    "- Cells flow through microfluidic chip\n",
    "- Each cell co-encapsulated with:\n",
    "  - **One gel bead** (contains ~750,000 barcoded primers)\n",
    "  - **RT reagents** (reverse transcription enzymes)\n",
    "  - **Oil** (forms droplet boundary)\n",
    "- Result: ~10,000 droplets (GEMs) per channel\n",
    "- Each GEM = individual reaction chamber\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Barcoding and Reverse Transcription\n",
    "- Gel beads dissolve, releasing primers\n",
    "- Each primer contains:\n",
    "  1. **Illumina adapter** (P5 or P7 for sequencing)\n",
    "  2. **Cell barcode** (16bp, unique to that bead)\n",
    "  3. **UMI** (Unique Molecular Identifier, 10-12bp)\n",
    "  4. **Poly(dT)** (captures mRNA poly-A tails)\n",
    "- mRNA reverse transcribed into cDNA\n",
    "- All transcripts in one droplet receive the **same cell barcode**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Breaking Emulsions and Cleanup\n",
    "- Break droplets with recovery agent\n",
    "- Pool all cDNA together\n",
    "- Cleanup to remove oil and unused primers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Library Preparation\n",
    "- Amplify cDNA by PCR\n",
    "- Fragment and add Illumina adapters\n",
    "- Size selection (~400-600bp)\n",
    "- Final library ready for sequencing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Sequencing\n",
    "- Illumina sequencing (NovaSeq, NextSeq)\n",
    "- Read 1: Cell barcode (16bp) + UMI (10-12bp)\n",
    "- Read 2: cDNA sequence (50-150bp)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Quality Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cell viability**: >70% (ideally >85%)\n",
    "- Dead cells release ambient RNA, creating \"soup\"\n",
    "- Causes contamination between droplets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cell concentration**: 700-1,200 cells/μL\n",
    "- Too low: Waste reagents, low yield\n",
    "- Too high: Multiplets (2+ cells in one droplet)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target cell recovery**: 10,000 cells per channel\n",
    "- Actual recovery: ~50-65% (5,000-6,500 cells)\n",
    "- Loss due to: empty droplets, doublets, QC filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of the 10X System\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High throughput**: Up to 80,000 cells per run (8 channels)\n",
    "2. **Low doublet rate**: ~1-2% (compared to 5-10% for Drop-seq)\n",
    "3. **Sensitive**: Detects 1,000-5,000 genes per cell (cell-type dependent)\n",
    "4. **Standardized**: Commercial reagents ensure reproducibility\n",
    "5. **Fast**: 30 minutes hands-on, library in 1 day\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of the 10X System\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **3' bias**: Only captures 3' end of transcripts (cannot detect isoforms)\n",
    "2. **Cost**: ~$1,000-2,000 per channel (reagents only)\n",
    "3. **Dropout**: Only ~10% of mRNA molecules captured per cell\n",
    "4. **Cell size bias**: Large cells (neurons) may be underrepresented\n",
    "5. **No nucleus**: Requires dissociated cells (may lose spatial info)\n",

    "## 5. Key Concepts: UMIs and Cell Barcodes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell Barcodes: Identifying Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cell barcodes** (also called \"cellular barcodes\" or \"CBs\") are short DNA sequences that uniquely identify which cell a read originated from.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "- Length: 16 base pairs (10X v3 chemistry)\n",
    "- Diversity: 4^16 = 4.3 billion possible sequences\n",
    "- Error correction: Hamming distance of 2 (detect 1bp errors)\n",
    "- Whitelist: 10X provides list of valid barcodes (~737,000 sequences)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Each gel bead has ~750,000 copies of primers with the **same** barcode\n",
    "2. When cell + bead encapsulated together, all transcripts receive that barcode\n",
    "3. During sequencing, we read the barcode in Read 1\n",
    "4. Assign each read to a cell based on its barcode\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quality control:**\n",
    "- Some barcodes are empty droplets (no cell)\n",
    "- Use read count distribution to distinguish real cells from empty droplets\n",
    "- CellRanger automatically filters low-quality barcodes\n",
    "\n",
    "### UMIs: Counting Molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs)** are random sequences added to each mRNA molecule during reverse transcription. They enable us to count **individual mRNA molecules** rather than sequencing reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why UMIs are critical:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without UMIs:**\n",
    "- 1 mRNA molecule → Many PCR duplicates during amplification\n",
    "- 100 reads might represent 1 molecule or 100 molecules\n",
    "- Cannot distinguish biological signal from technical amplification bias\n",
    "\n",
    "**With UMIs:**\n",
    "- Each mRNA molecule receives a unique UMI during RT\n",
    "- After sequencing, collapse reads with same: Cell barcode + Gene + UMI\n",
    "- Count unique UMIs = count molecules\n",
    "- Removes PCR bias and amplification artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "**UMI structure in 10X:**\n",
    "- Length: 10-12 base pairs\n",
    "- Diversity: 4^12 = 16.7 million possible sequences\n",
    "- Random: Each mRNA molecule gets different UMI (statistically)\n",
    "- Error correction: Similar UMIs collapsed if associated with same gene\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Raw reads:\n",
    "Cell_A + Gene_X + UMI_123 (50 reads)\n",
    "Cell_A + Gene_X + UMI_456 (30 reads)\n",
    "Cell_A + Gene_Y + UMI_789 (100 reads)\n",
    "\n",
    "After UMI collapsing:\n",
    "Cell_A + Gene_X = 2 UMIs → 2 molecules detected\n",
    "Cell_A + Gene_Y = 1 UMI → 1 molecule detected\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### From FASTQ to Count Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The bioinformatics pipeline (e.g., CellRanger) performs these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Demultiplexing**: Assign reads to samples (if multiplexed)\n",
    "2. **Barcode correction**: Match to whitelist, correct 1bp errors\n",
    "3. **UMI extraction**: Extract UMI sequence from Read 1\n",
    "4. **Alignment**: Map Read 2 to reference genome/transcriptome\n",
    "5. **Gene assignment**: Determine which gene each read came from\n",
    "6. **UMI counting**: \n",
    "   - Group reads by: Cell barcode + Gene + UMI\n",
    "   - Count unique UMIs per cell-gene combination\n",
    "7. **Cell calling**: Distinguish real cells from empty droplets\n",
    "8. **Matrix generation**: Create gene × cell matrix of UMI counts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** A **sparse matrix** where:\n",
    "- Rows = genes (~20,000-30,000)\n",
    "- Columns = cells (~1,000-100,000)\n",

    "1. **Dying/dead cells**: Release RNA into solution, high mitochondrial content\n",

    "#### 1. **Total UMI Counts (Library Size)**\n",

    "- **Expected range**: 1,000-10,000 for 10X (cell-type dependent)\n",
    "- **Low values indicate**: Empty droplets, debris, or poor capture efficiency\n",
    "- **High values indicate**: Doublets or very large cells (neurons)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Genes Detected per Cell**\n",
    "- **What it measures**: Number of genes with at least 1 UMI\n",
    "- **Expected range**: 500-5,000 for 10X\n",
    "- **Low values indicate**: Low-quality cells, empty droplets\n",
    "- **High values indicate**: Doublets or transcriptionally active cells\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Mitochondrial Gene Percentage**\n",
    "- **What it measures**: % of UMIs from mitochondrial genes (MT-*)\n",
    "- **Expected range**: <5-20% depending on tissue\n",
