## Overview

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our ability to study gene expression at the individual cell level. This module introduces the principles, technologies, and applications of single-cell approaches in neuroscience.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles of single-cell RNA sequencing
- Learn about different scRNA-seq platforms and technologies
- Recognize applications of single-cell approaches in neuroscience
- Appreciate the advantages and limitations of single-cell technologies
- Identify key experimental design considerations
:::

## Why Single-Cell?

### Limitations of Bulk RNA-seq

Traditional bulk RNA sequencing analyzes the average gene expression across millions of cells, masking:

- Cellular heterogeneity
- Rare cell populations
- Cell-state transitions
- Cell-type-specific responses

### Single-Cell Revolution

::: {.card}
**Single-cell technologies enable**:

- Cell-type identification and characterization
- Discovery of rare cell populations
- Trajectory and lineage inference
- Cell-state dynamics
- Spatial organization (with spatial methods)

## Single-Cell RNA-seq Workflow

### 1. Sample Preparation

- Tissue dissociation
- Cell isolation and purification
- Quality control of cell viability
- Cell counting and concentration

### 2. Cell Capture & Barcoding

**Common platforms**:

- **10x Genomics Chromium**: Droplet-based, high-throughput
- **Smart-seq2/3**: Full-length transcripts, plate-based
- **Drop-seq**: Open-source droplet platform
- **inDrop**: Droplet-based with in-house barcodes
- **CITE-seq**: Simultaneous RNA and protein
:::

## 10x Genomics Technology

### Chromium Platform

The most widely used commercial single-cell platform:

**Key Features**:

- Droplet-based cell capture
- Gel bead-based barcoding
- 3' or 5' gene expression profiling
- High throughput (500-10,000 cells per sample)
- Multiome capabilities (RNA + ATAC)
:::

### How It Works

1. **Cell suspension** is loaded into the Chromium controller
2. **Gel beads** containing barcoded oligonucleotides
3. **Droplets** encapsulate single cells with gel beads
4. **Cell lysis** and reverse transcription within droplets
5. **Unique barcodes** tag each cell's transcripts
6. **Pool and sequence** all cells together

- **Patch-seq**: Electrophysiology + transcriptomics

## Experimental Design Considerations

### Sample Size

- Number of biological replicates
- Cells per sample (technical depth)
- Statistical power considerations

### Technical Considerations

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Factors

- Fresh vs. frozen tissue
- Cell viability requirements
- Capture efficiency (typically 50-80%)
- Sequencing depth (reads per cell)
- Batch effects and confounders
:::

### Cost Considerations

- Per-cell costs
- Sequencing costs
- Computational infrastructure
- Trade-off: more cells vs. deeper sequencing

## Quality Control Metrics

### Cell-Level QC

- Number of detected genes (complexity)
- Total UMI counts (sequencing depth)
- Mitochondrial content (cell stress/death)
- Doublet detection

### Gene-Level QC

- Genes detected across cells
- Expression distribution
- Technical noise estimation

## Challenges and Limitations

1. **Technical noise**: Dropout events, amplification bias
2. **Cost**: Still expensive for large studies
3. **Computational demands**: Large datasets, complex analyses
4. **Batch effects**: Technical variation across experiments
5. **Interpretation**: Biological meaning of clusters
