## What is Neurogenomics?

Neurogenomics is the study of how the genome influences the development, structure, and function of the nervous system. It combines principles from:

- **Genomics**: Study of entire genomes and their functions
- **Neuroscience**: Study of the nervous system and brain
- **Genetics**: Study of heredity and variation in organisms
- **Molecular Biology**: Study of biological processes at the molecular level

## The Brain and Genetic Information

### Complexity of the Human Brain

- Approximately 86 billion neurons
- Trillions of synaptic connections
- ~20,000 protein-coding genes expressed in the brain
- Complex spatial and temporal gene expression patterns

### Gene Expression in the Brain

::: {.card}
Different brain regions show distinct gene expression profiles:

- **Cerebral cortex**: Higher cognitive functions
- **Hippocampus**: Memory formation and consolidation
- **Striatum**: Motor control and reward processing
- **Cerebellum**: Motor coordination and learning

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: APOE and Alzheimer's Disease

The APOE gene has three common variants (ε2, ε3, ε4) that significantly influence Alzheimer's disease risk:

- APOE-ε4 increases risk and lowers age of onset
- APOE-ε2 provides protective effects
- Example of common genetic variation affecting brain health

### Case Study 2: Single-Cell Atlases of Brain

Recent single-cell studies have revealed:

- Unprecedented cellular diversity in the brain
- Cell-type-specific gene expression signatures
- Disease-associated cell populations
- Molecular mechanisms of brain disorders

## Challenges in Neurogenomics

1. **Cellular Heterogeneity**: Brain contains hundreds of cell types
2. **Technical Limitations**: Accessing brain tissue in living subjects
3. **Complexity**: Polygenic nature of most brain disorders
4. **Data Integration**: Combining multi-modal datasets
5. **Causality**: Distinguishing correlation from causation

## Future Directions
